# Description
Given votes cast using ranked ballots, the goal is to determine a winner by majority.
Votes are cast using a Map consisting of a List of string candidates and an integer representing the total number of such ballots cast.
An example ballot can be:

A, B, C -> 4

B, A, C -> 3

etc.

# Compilation
This was built using Java 11.
To compile this, simply build and run the VotingSystems.java file (which will build the associated class).
Inputs are provided in the Main function.
In fact, ample example test cases are provided, but other cases can be added in a similar fashion.
